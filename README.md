## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This is a simple project but I learned a lot of new things, as using a google font,
new css commands like "border-radius", "font-weight" and "rem" for text-size:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit">
```
```css
.body {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 700;
}
.content{
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

Hope to continue learning responsive designs and new css and html techniques.
